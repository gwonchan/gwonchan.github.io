During my graduate study, I found that I like to analyze raw data to make it meaningful to show other people. Moreover, it was my dream to find a rule or theory for scientific or engineering problems.

After my postdoc, I tried to find a permanent position but failed. when I considered to go back to my home country and read an article in a science magazine about a story of a postdoc who change her career to data science, and I decided to change my career.

It was not easy to get time for study cause I have two kids and I should do something to make money like home appliances technician or engineer jobs. I have changed jobs 6 times for the last 6 years like a teenager's wondering.
I hope this is my final educational step in my career life.
