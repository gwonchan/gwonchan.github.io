During my graduate study, I found that I like to analysis raw data to make it meaningful to show other people. Moreover it was my dream to find a rule or theory for scientific or engineering problems.

After my postdoc, I tried to find permanent position but failed. when I considered to go back my home country, and read an article in science magizine about a story of postdoc who change her career to data science, and I decided to change my career.

It was not easy to get time for study cause I have two kids and I should do someting to make money like home appliance technicion or engineer jobs. I have changed jobs 6 times for last 6 years like a teenager's wondering.
I hope this is my final educatinal step in my career life.
